## Setup

To setup the python environment I did:

```bash
conda create -p ./.conda python=3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then activated the environment with:
```bash
conda activate ./.conda
```

To run the frontend you can type:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_frontend.py
```

Happy Agent Building :D
